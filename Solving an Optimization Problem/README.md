Optimization Overview

You may not realize it, but optimization is a part of our daily lives. 
Take running errands, for example. There are many ways to get from your house to the grocery store, but how do you find the quickest route? 
Well, the GPS says this way looks good, but while you're driving, traffic develops. Now what's the fastest route?

Optimization problems all involve minimizing or maximizing something called an objective function, 
which represents the quantity that you'd like to optimize, but they can be hard to solve since they can have 
limitations placed on the allowable solutions.
